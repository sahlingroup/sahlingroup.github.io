<h1>PhD position</h1>

I'm looking for a PhD student in Computational Biology.  The call will be open 15th of October - 5th of November, 2021. You are welcome to apply through Stockholm University's ReachMee portal (link will be provided here when call opens). General information below.

<h3>General description</h3>
The group led by Kristoffer Sahlin primarily works on problems in the area of Computational Biology. Computational Biology can be seen as an interdisciplinary research field between Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, and Biology. Researchers in Computational Biology typically study and design algorithms, data structures, and statistical models to extract information or gain insights from large biological datasets.Â 

<h3>Project description</h3>
DNA and RNA play an essential role in determining the state and condition of cells and tissue and, therefore, hold key information to study diseases, traits, and evolution. We can now access DNA and RNA sequencing data at a large scale and low cost. However, the computational methods to extract information from the data could be improved in terms of accuracy, runtime, and memory usage in many applications. The successful applicant will design efficient algorithms to store, query, and process large sequencing datasets that can help biological and biomedical researchers in their analysis.

<h3>Other information</h3>
We are looking o hire a Ph.D. student who is ambitious and highly motivated by problem-solving. The applicant is expected to have, or be near completion, of a Master's degree (or equivalent knowledge) in a relevant subject such as computer science, mathematics, mathematical statistics, or related field. It is good if the applicant has an interest and familiarity with programming. Bioinformatic/biological familiarity or experience with sequencing data is an advantage but is not required. <br>
<br>
The applicant can expect to develop into an interdisciplinary and independent researcher with knowledge in algorithm design and statistical methods, particularly for large-scale life science and biology datasets. The position is available at the Department of Mathematics at Stockholm University in the Division of Computational Mathematics. The group of Kristoffer Sahlin is located at the interdisciplinary research facility SciLifeLab in proximity to the campus of Karolinska Institute, where the working atmosphere is international with English as the working language. <br>
